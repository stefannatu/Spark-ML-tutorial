PySpark tutorial on California Housing Dataset
I work through the PySpark tutorial from DataCamp to play with RDDs and use SparkML functions on a simple dataset -- the California Housing Dataset. 
After doing some data exploration, I train and compare a Random Forest regression and a Linear Regression Model.The model has a much lower RMSE than the tutorial model as well as the scikit learn model by Geron. 
To do even better, one could perform a grid search on hyperparameters.
